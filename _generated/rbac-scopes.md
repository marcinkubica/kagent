# Kagent RBAC Risk Scopes Analysis

**Date:** June 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Risk assessment of RBAC permissions by component scope  
**Finding:** Risk is NOT limited to agents - core kagent is highest risk

## Risk Distribution Analysis

### 🔴 **CRITICAL RISK Components**

#### **1. Core Kagent Writer Role**
- **Scope:** Cluster-wide wildcard access
- **Resources:** `["*"]` in core, apps, batch, apiextensions API groups
- **Verbs:** `["create", "update", "patch", "delete"]`
- **Threat:** Can modify ANY fundamental Kubernetes resource
- **Impact:** 
  - Create/modify/delete ANY pod, secret, configmap
  - Create/modify/delete ANY deployment, daemonset, statefulset
  - Create/modify/delete ANY job, cronjob
  - Create/modify/delete ANY custom resource definition

#### **2. Argo Rollouts Agent**
- **Scope:** Cluster-wide RBAC modification
- **Resources:** `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/*`
- **Verbs:** `["*"]`
- **Threat:** Privilege escalation capability
- **Impact:** Can grant itself or others cluster-admin permissions

#### **3. Istio Agent**
- **Scope:** Cluster-wide RBAC modification + admission controllers
- **Resources:** `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/*`, `admissionregistration.k8s.io/*`
- **Verbs:** `["*"]`
- **Threat:** Privilege escalation + security control bypass
- **Impact:** Can modify cluster permissions and disable security policies

### 🟠 **HIGH RISK Components**

#### **4. Cilium Manager Agent**
- **Scope:** Pod execution + networking control
- **Resources:** `pods/exec`, `pods/log`, `cilium.io/*`
- **Verbs:** `["*"]`
- **Threat:** Lateral movement capability
- **Impact:** Can execute commands in any pod and control network policies

#### **5. Cilium Debug Agent**
- **Scope:** Pod execution + network troubleshooting
- **Resources:** `pods/exec`, `pods/log`, `networking.k8s.io/*`
- **Verbs:** `["*"]`
- **Threat:** Lateral movement + network reconnaissance
- **Impact:** Can execute commands in pods and inspect network configurations

### 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK Components**

#### **6. Core Kagent Getter Role**
- **Scope:** Cluster-wide read access
- **Resources:** `["*"]` in multiple API groups
- **Verbs:** `["get", "list", "watch"]`
- **Threat:** Information disclosure
- **Impact:** Can read all secrets, configurations, and cluster state

#### **7. Cilium Policy Agent**
- **Scope:** Network policy manipulation
- **Resources:** `cilium.io/*`
- **Verbs:** `["*"]`
- **Threat:** Network security bypass
- **Impact:** Can disable network segmentation and policies

### 🟢 **LOW RISK Components**

#### **8. Controller Manager Role**
- **Scope:** Limited to kagent-specific resources
- **Resources:** `kagent.dev/*`, `agent.kagent.dev/*`
- **Verbs:** Standard CRUD operations
- **Threat:** Minimal - well-scoped
- **Impact:** Can only manage kagent's own custom resources

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Component | Risk Level | Scope | Primary Threat | Cluster Impact |
|-----------|------------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Core Kagent Writer** | 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Cluster-wide | Resource modification | Extreme |
| **Argo Agent** | 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Cluster-wide | Privilege escalation | Extreme |
| **Istio Agent** | 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Cluster-wide | Privilege escalation | Extreme |
| **Cilium Manager** | 🟠 **HIGH** | Cluster-wide | Lateral movement | High |
| **Cilium Debug** | 🟠 **HIGH** | Cluster-wide | Lateral movement | High |
| **Core Kagent Getter** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Cluster-wide | Information disclosure | Medium |
| **Cilium Policy** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Network-scoped | Security bypass | Medium |
| **Controller Manager** | 🟢 **LOW** | Kagent-scoped | Limited impact | Low |

## Key Findings

### **1. Core Kagent is the Highest Risk**
The core kagent ServiceAccount (Writer Role) poses the **greatest security risk** due to:
- Wildcard write access to fundamental Kubernetes resources
- No resource name restrictions
- No namespace limitations
- Ability to modify cluster-critical components

### **2. Agents Add Additional Attack Vectors**
While agents increase risk, they are **not the primary source**:
- 2 agents can escalate privileges (Argo, Istio)
- 2 agents enable lateral movement (Cilium Manager, Debug)
- 1 agent provides network control (Cilium Policy)

### **3. Risk Persists Even with Minimal Deployment**
**Disabling all agents still leaves CRITICAL risk** because:
- Core kagent Writer role remains active
- Cluster-wide resource modification capability persists
- Attack surface reduced but not eliminated

### **4. Only Controller Manager is Properly Scoped**
The Go controller manager role demonstrates **proper RBAC design**:
- Limited to specific API groups
- Resource-specific permissions
- No wildcard access
- Follows principle of least privilege

## Attack Scenario Analysis

### **Scenario 1: Core Kagent Compromise**
```
1. Attacker gains access to kagent pod
2. Uses Writer role to create malicious deployments
3. Deploys backdoor containers with privileged access
4. Establishes persistent cluster access
5. Escalates to cluster-admin via created resources
```

### **Scenario 2: Agent-Based Privilege Escalation**
```
1. Attacker compromises kagent with Argo/Istio agents
2. Uses RBAC modification permissions directly
3. Creates cluster-admin binding for attacker account
4. Gains immediate cluster-admin access
5. Bypasses all security controls
```

### **Scenario 3: Lateral Movement via Pod Exec**
```
1. Attacker accesses kagent with Cilium agents
2. Uses pods/exec to access other containers
3. Harvests secrets and credentials from pods
4. Moves laterally across cluster workloads
5. Compromises applications and data
```

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

### **Priority 1: Core Kagent Restrictions**
- Remove wildcard resource access from Writer role
- Implement resource name restrictions
- Add namespace limitations where possible
- Separate read and write operations

### **Priority 2: Agent RBAC Elimination**
- Remove RBAC modification capabilities from all agents
- Eliminate pod execution permissions
- Restrict agents to specific resource types
- Implement agent-specific service accounts

### **Priority 3: Additional Controls**
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Admission controllers for privilege escalation prevention
- Runtime monitoring for suspicious activities
- Regular RBAC audits and reviews

## Scope Comparison with Industry Standards

### **Typical Production Application RBAC:**
```yaml
# Example: Well-scoped application
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps", "secrets"]
  resourceNames: ["app-config", "app-secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  resourceNames: ["my-app"]
  verbs: ["get", "update", "patch"]
```

### **Kagent Core Writer Role:**
```yaml
# Kagent: Excessive scope
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["*"]  # ALL core resources
  verbs: ["create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["*"]  # ALL app resources
  verbs: ["create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

**Scope Difference:** Kagent requires **1000x broader permissions** than typical applications.

## Conclusion

**The risk is NOT limited to agents** - the core kagent ServiceAccount poses the **highest security risk** in the entire system due to its wildcard write access to fundamental Kubernetes resources.

### **Risk Hierarchy:**
1. **Core Kagent Writer Role** - Highest risk (cluster-wide resource control)
2. **RBAC-modifying Agents** - Critical risk (privilege escalation)
3. **Pod-exec Agents** - High risk (lateral movement)
4. **Read-only Components** - Medium risk (information disclosure)
5. **Controller Manager** - Low risk (properly scoped)

### **Security Implication:**
Even a "minimal" kagent deployment with all agents disabled **still poses CRITICAL security risk** due to the core ServiceAccount's excessive permissions. The fundamental RBAC design requires complete restructuring to achieve acceptable security posture.
