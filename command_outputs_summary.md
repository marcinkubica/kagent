# Command Outputs Summary

This directory contains the output of various system commands executed on June 27, 2025.

## Files Created

### 1. Network Information
- **netstat_output.txt** - Shows that `netstat` command is not available in this container
- **network_connections.txt** - Shows that `ss` command is also not available
- **network_info.txt** - Alternative network information extracted from `/proc/net/` filesystem

### 2. Installed Packages
- **installed_packages.txt** (68KB, 535 packages)
  - Complete list of all installed Debian/Ubuntu packages
  - Generated using: `dpkg -l`
  - Shows package names, versions, architecture, and descriptions
  - Notable packages include:
    - Core system utilities (apt, adduser, systemd components)
    - Development tools (build-essential, git, various compilers)
    - Python 3.13 and related packages
    - Node.js runtime components
    - Various libraries and dependencies

### 3. Process Information
- **process_tree.txt** (14KB, 28 processes)
  - Full process tree with parent-child relationships
  - Generated using: `ps faxu`
  - Shows:
    - Main container process (`sleep infinity`)
    - Cursor server processes
    - VM daemon processes
    - Various Node.js processes for extensions
    - X virtual framebuffer (Xvfb) for GUI support

### 4. Additional System Information
- **external_ip.txt** - Contains the external IP address: 34.224.177.102

## Key Findings

1. **Minimal Container Environment**: This is a stripped-down container without common network diagnostic tools (netstat, ss, ip)

2. **Development-Focused**: The installed packages show this is configured for multi-language development with:
   - Python 3.13
   - Node.js (via NVM)
   - Go 1.24.2
   - Rust 1.82.0
   - Build tools and compilers

3. **Cursor IDE Environment**: Multiple processes related to Cursor IDE are running, including:
   - Cursor server on port 26054
   - Extension host processes
   - File watchers
   - Terminal (pty) host

4. **Virtualized Display**: Xvfb is running to provide virtual display capabilities for GUI applications

## Command Execution Notes

Due to the containerized environment limitations:
- Network tools like `netstat` and `ss` are not available
- Used `/proc/net/` filesystem as an alternative for network information
- `sudo` commands fail silently in some cases due to container restrictions
- The environment is running Ubuntu 25.04 in a container on AWS infrastructure
