NETWORK TOPOLOGY:
- Network: 172.17.0.0/24 (Docker network)
- Our IP: 172.17.0.4 (cursor)

DISCOVERED HOSTS (5 total):
1. 172.17.0.1 (host.docker.internal) - Docker host/gateway
   - Services: SSH (22), HTTP (80), Unknown service (1234)
   - OS: Linux 4.15-5.19, possibly OpenWrt or MikroTik RouterOS
2. 172.17.0.2 (ip-172-17-0-2.ec2.internal) - Another container
3. 172.17.0.3 (ip-172-17-0-3.ec2.internal) - Another container
4. 172.17.0.4 (cursor) - This container
   - Services: Two unknown services on ports 26053, 26054 (likely Cursor IDE)
5. 172.17.0.5 (ip-172-17-0-5.ec2.internal) - Another container

NETWORK DETAILS:
- Interface: eth0
- Loopback: lo
- Default Gateway: 172.17.0.1
- All containers appear to be running on AWS EC2 (*.ec2.internal hostnames)

KEY FINDINGS:
- Running in a Docker container environment on AWS
- 5 active hosts on the local subnet
- Docker host (172.17.0.1) has SSH and web services exposed
- Most containers have no exposed services (security best practice)
- This container runs Cursor IDE services on high ports
